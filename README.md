Welcome to a New Year of Preppin' Data challenges. For anyone new to the challenges then let us give you an overview how the weekly challenge works. 
Each Wednesday the Preppin' crew (Jenny, myself or a guest contributor) drop a data set(s) that requires some reshaping and/or cleaning to get it ready for analysis. 
You can use any tool or language you want to do the reshaping (we build the challenges in Tableau Prep but love seeing different tools being learnt / tried).
Share your solution on LinkedIn, Twitter/X, GitHub or the Tableau Forums
Fill out our tracker so you can monitor your progress and involvement
The following Tuesday we will post a written solution in Tableau Prep (thanks Tom) and a video walkthrough too (thanks Jenny)
As with each January for the last few years, we'll set a number of challenges aimed at beginners. This is a great way to learn a number of fundamental data preparation skills or a chance to learn a new tool â€” New Year's resolution anyone? So on to this year's challenges!
Context
At Preppin' Data we use a number of (mock) companies to look at the challenges they have with their data. For January, we're going to focus on our own airline, Prep Air. The airline has introduced a new loyalty card called the Flow Card. We need to clean up a number of data sets to determine how well the card is doing. 

The first task is setting some context for later weeks by understanding how popular the Flow Card is. Our stakeholder would like two data sets about our passengers. One data set for card users and one data set for those who don't use the card.
